				<p>Churn Analysis would help us in analyzing why customers leave, engage those customers by improving communication and loyalty, develop effective marketing strategies to target customers and to increase the profit. Now that we understand what churn is, the next step is to learn how to analyze it. So, before we try to improve our churn rate, we need to identify problem areas so that we can focus and prioritize them.
You can begin to segment you customer base by lifecycle stages. There are 3 broad categories that any customer base can be organized by:
New, Active, and Churn.
</p>

				<p>New Customers are individuals who have recently made their first purchase (or other transaction). They are taking you for a test drive, no basis for trust has been established yet, and they are most relatively sensitive to all aspects of their experience with your organization (website experience, digital presence, customer service, etc.)</p>
<p>Active Customers are those who have been recently active beyond a first purchase or predefined new customer engagement period. The degree to which they are active will be further defined when we dig deeper into sub-segmentation. The range can include brand advocates, repeat customers, and discount/special offer purchasers.</p>

<p>Customers in the churn stage of the lifecycle have been inactive or not made a purchase for an extended period of time.</p>
